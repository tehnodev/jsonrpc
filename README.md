# jsonrpc
Server implementation for [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). Work in progress.

This library transforms json-rpc request string into json-rpc response string by executing methods from given class.

No dependencies. No exceptions are thrown. No assumptions from where you get request string.
Library does just one thing and nothing more.
